This is a simple assignment with some basic needs:

* Create a new account to a new user;
* The user must be able to withdraw money;
* The user must be able to deposit some money;
* The user must be able to check s/he's account balance.

Those needs give run to assumptions (like: if the user withdraw more money than it has)

The code must be tested/testable and layers must be mocked.

My first implementation is a really poor usage of DDD (mostly using Entity+Repository).
